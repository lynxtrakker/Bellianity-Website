# Bellianity
## What is this?
This is the website that is used for ***`Bellianity`***. This is where you can access things like the server shop and the server rules.

## What is Bellianity?
**Bellianity** is a minecraft server that started in early 2021 when one of LynxTrakker's friends suggested that he start a group that revolves around the belief that bells are the best item in Minecraft. Then about a month after that, Lynxtrakker launched a server on Minecraft: Java Edition.
